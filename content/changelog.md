* Added replay functionality

  While attempting to solve a deal, every move is saved to an undo stack. The player can now "replay" those moves afterward, and can share that sequence of moves so that anyone who clicks on the shared link will be able to see the same sequence of moves.

### 20 June 2023
* Added this changelog
* Fixed a bug on Spider games that allowed moving stacks of cards that were not the same suit
