# About Solitaire Table

[Solitaire Table] is an installable [PWA] made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com),
hosted on Github, open source, and free for use with no advertising.
It was created by [David Hunt] (me) over a few evenings and weekends in September/October 2021, mainly as a way to learn SvelteKit and because none of
my solitaire apps would play [pyramid solitaire] the way I like and my phone app had a wonky UI for Klondike.
